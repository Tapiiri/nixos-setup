# --- Home Manager integration -------------------------------------------------
#
# This repo symlinks this file to ~/.bashrc, while Home Manager may also manage
# Bash settings. To keep both worlds working together:
# - Load Home Manager session variables (PATH, locale, etc.)
# - Load Home Manager's generated bash init (which contains `bashrcExtra`, etc.)
#
# Both are optional and safe to source.
